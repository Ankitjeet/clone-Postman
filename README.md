Postman is a popular application programming interface that makes it easy for developers to create, share, test and document APIs. This is done by allowing the users to create and save simple and complex HTTP/s requests, as well as read their responses. It can make various types of HTTP requests like GET, POST, PUT, PATCH, saving environments for later use, converting the API to code for various languages like JavaScript
